Thoughts:
-	Harris Corners provide a list of corners but they do not seem to be KeyPoint objects
		returns dst, which is an image, not keypoints
-	FAST finds corners also but actually returns keypoints
-	ORB uses a combination of FAST and Harris to get keypoints then generates descriptors
-	BRISK is another alternative
-	BF-Matching requires descriptors to work

Problems:
-	SIFT and SURF are patented, can't use
-	ORB is not finding any keypoints or descriptors from our images
-	Need to figure out how to convert dst into keypoints
	OR
-	Figure out how to run ORB with keypoints from FAST

We have:
	-	keypoints: FAST
	-	descriptors: BRISK
	-	matches: FLANN
		(problems drawing the matches but we are going to ignore that for now)
Next Steps:
	-	Implement Homography to find Objects
		(http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_feature_homography/py_feature_homography.html#feature-matching-homography-to-find-objects)
	-	build query image from all the images in the training set (combine_images.py) - DONE
	-	guess_digit.py:
		for each image in validation: 
			run matcher against query image
			locate object match
			determine what the digit is based on the objects location in the query image
			keep track of correct, incorrect and total

Evaluation Metrics:
	-	Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives)/all
	-	Precision = True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)
	-	Recall = True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)
