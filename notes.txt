Thoughts:
-	Harris Corners provide a list of corners but they do not seem to be KeyPoint objects
		returns dst, which is an image, not keypoints
-	FAST finds corners also but actually returns keypoints
-	ORB uses a combination of FAST and Harris to get keypoints then generates descriptors
-	BRISK is another alternative
-	BF-Matching requires descriptors to work

Problems:
-	SIFT and SURF are patented, can't use
-	ORB is not finding any keypoints or descriptors from our images
-	Need to figure out how to convert dst into keypoints
	OR
-	Figure out how to run ORB with keypoints from FAST

WHY WON'T ORB OR BRISK FIND ANY DESCRIPTORS
KAZE and AKAZE don't find any either...
